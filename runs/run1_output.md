### Constraints & Guardrails
- No PII or team names in outputs.
- Do not cite raw quotes in emails/slides; paraphrase only.
- Suppress any subgroup reporting <10 responses.
- Tone: exec-ready but cautious; avoid causal language without evidence.

### Assumptions
- Suppression threshold is assumed to be 10 responses.

### Open Questions (if any)
- What suppression threshold should be applied?

## Skill 3: Readiness Brief

## Results Readiness Brief
### What happened (facts only)
- Participation: 74.6%
- Overall favorability: 68% (–4pp vs prior)
- Top positive drivers: Manager support 78% (+3pp), Inclusion 75% (+2pp)
- Top negative drivers: Career growth 52% (–7pp), Workload 49% (–6pp)
- eNPS: +12 (prior +18)

### What it likely means
The data may indicate pressure around growth clarity and workload while manager support signals remain relatively stronger.

### What to do next (prioritized actions)
1. HRBP + business leader: publish role progression criteria within 30 days.
2. Ops lead: rebalance workload and on-call distribution in next planning cycle.
3. Manager enablement lead: launch coaching refresh for quality + feedback within 45 days.

### What we should not conclude
- Do not infer causation between comments and business outcomes without additional data.
- Do not generalize subgroup findings where suppression thresholds may apply.

### Confidence & Data Limits
Findings are based only on provided metrics/comments and should be treated as directional.
