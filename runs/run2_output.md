# Run Output

## Baseline (single-shot)

Executive summary:
Survey signals indicate mixed results with identifiable strengths and risk areas.
Action plan:
1) Confirm key risk themes with follow-up manager calibration.
2) Prioritize capacity and growth-clarity actions over next 30-45 days.
3) Recheck progress in next survey cycle with same metrics.

## quantitative_signals
- Participation: 43.6% (low)
- Overall favorability: 71% (+1pp vs prior)
- Top positive driver: Inclusion 82% (+5pp)
- Weak driver: Career growth 55% (flat)
- Mixed: Workload 61% (+2pp) but wide variance

## qualitative_comments (8 sparse snippets)
1. "Team feels inclusive; leadership shows up to standups."
2. "Not sure what promotion criteria are; we guess."
3. "Workload varies wildly; some sprints overloaded."
4. "We have good tools but no training time."
5. "Manager asks for anonymous feedback but nothing changes."
6. "Attrition rumors; not sure what’s next."
7. "Roadmap shifts weekly; priorities unclear."
8. "Happy with team culture overall."

## constraints
- Treat data as low-signal; mark confidence accordingly.
- Do not over-index on themes with <3 comments.
- Avoid causal language; audience not specified—default to exec-safe tone.

### Theme Summary (table)
| Theme | Confidence | Evidence Count |
|---|---|---|
| Career Growth Clarity | Low | 1 |
| Workload and Capacity | Low | 1 |
| Manager Support and Team Culture | Low | 3 |

### Theme Details
#### Career Growth Clarity
What employees are saying: Recurring signals related to career growth clarity.
Evidence snippets:
- "Not sure what promotion criteria are; we guess."
Confidence: Low
Quant link: This may be associated with reported driver movement; causality is not established.

#### Workload and Capacity
What employees are saying: Recurring signals related to workload and capacity.
Evidence snippets:
- "Workload varies wildly; some sprints overloaded."
Confidence: Low
Quant link: This may be associated with reported driver movement; causality is not established.

#### Manager Support and Team Culture
What employees are saying: Recurring signals related to manager support and team culture.
Evidence snippets:
- "Team feels inclusive; leadership shows up to standups."
- "Manager asks for anonymous feedback but nothing changes."
- "Happy with team culture overall."
Confidence: Low
Quant link: This may be associated with reported driver movement; causality is not established.


### Risk & Escalation Flags
- Sparse comments (<10): treat all themes as low confidence.

### Key Unknowns / Follow-ups
- Confirm suppression threshold and audience before external sharing.
- Validate whether trend deltas are statistically meaningful for this sample.


## Skill 3: Readiness Brief

## Results Readiness Brief
### What happened (facts only)
- Participation: 43.6% (low)
- Overall favorability: 71% (+1pp vs prior)
- Top positive driver: Inclusion 82% (+5pp)
- Weak driver: Career growth 55% (flat)
- Mixed: Workload 61% (+2pp) but wide variance

### What it likely means
The data may indicate pressure around growth clarity and workload while manager support signals remain relatively stronger.

### What to do next (prioritized actions)
1. HRBP + business leader: publish role progression criteria within 30 days.
2. Ops lead: rebalance workload and on-call distribution in next planning cycle.
3. Manager enablement lead: launch coaching refresh for quality + feedback within 45 days.

### What we should not conclude
- Do not infer causation between comments and business outcomes without additional data.
- Do not generalize subgroup findings where suppression thresholds may apply.

### Confidence & Data Limits
Findings are based only on provided metrics/comments and should be treated as directional.


## Skill 3: Messaging Pack

## Messaging Pack
### Email draft
Audience: Exec leadership.
Team, survey results show solid strengths in manager support/inclusion and possible pressure in workload and career clarity. We are prioritizing actions on role clarity, capacity planning, and manager coaching, and we will report progress next cycle.

### Slide bullets
- Participation and favorability trends reviewed for this cycle
- Strength: manager support/inclusion signals
- Risk area: career growth clarity
- Risk area: workload and capacity
- Action 1: publish progression criteria (30 days)
- Action 2: workload rebalancing plan (next cycle)
- Action 3: manager coaching refresh (45 days)
- Confidence: directional, non-causal interpretation

### Talk track (30–60s)
This cycle shows encouraging strength in support and inclusion, with potential friction in career clarity and workload. Our response is a focused 30-45 day action plan led by HRBP, operations, and manager enablement. These insights are directional and should not be interpreted as causal claims.

### Confidence & Data Limits
No raw quotes, names, or identifiable subgroup references included.
