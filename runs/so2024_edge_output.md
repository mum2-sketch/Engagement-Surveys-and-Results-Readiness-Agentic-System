# Run Output

## Baseline (single-shot)

Executive summary:
Survey signals indicate mixed results with identifiable strengths and risk areas.
Action plan:
1) Confirm key risk themes with follow-up manager calibration.
2) Prioritize capacity and growth-clarity actions over next 30-45 days.
3) Recheck progress in next survey cycle with same metrics.

### Constraints & Guardrails
- Treat this as derived proxy sentiment from structured fields; do not claim direct verbatim employee quotes.
- Avoid causal language unless explicit causal evidence is provided.
- Keep messaging executive-safe and include confidence/data limits.
- Do not include personal identifiers.

### Assumptions
- Survey type assumed to be engagement pulse.
- Suppression threshold is assumed to be 10 responses.

### Open Questions (if any)
- Can you confirm survey type (ES/PPS/MLS)?
- What suppression threshold should be applied?

### Theme Summary (table)
| Theme | Confidence | Evidence Count |
|---|---|---|
| Work Arrangement Patterns | Low | 1 |
| Skills and Technology Demand | Low | 2 |
| Employment and Labor Market Mix | Low | 1 |

### Theme Details
#### Work Arrangement Patterns
What employees are saying: Recurring signals related to work arrangement patterns.
Evidence snippets:
- "Top remote-work patterns: NA (34), Hybrid (some remote, some in-person) (33), Remote (31)."
Confidence: Low
Quant link: This may be associated with reported driver movement; causality is not established.

#### Skills and Technology Demand
What employees are saying: Recurring signals related to skills and technology demand.
Evidence snippets:
- "Most used languages currently: JavaScript (90), Python (73), SQL (73), HTML/CSS (72)."
- "Most desired languages next year: JavaScript (59), Python (56), SQL (52), HTML/CSS (47)."
Confidence: Low
Quant link: This may be associated with reported driver movement; causality is not established.

#### Employment and Labor Market Mix
What employees are saying: Recurring signals related to employment and labor market mix.
Evidence snippets:
- "Common employment categories: Employed, full-time (44), Independent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed (35), Not e"
Confidence: Low
Quant link: This may be associated with reported driver movement; causality is not established.


### Risk & Escalation Flags
- Sparse comments (<10): treat all themes as low confidence.

### Key Unknowns / Follow-ups
- Confirm suppression threshold and audience before external sharing.
- Validate whether trend deltas are statistically meaningful for this sample.


## Skill 3: Readiness Brief

## Results Readiness Brief
### What happened (facts only)
- Selected response count: 120
- Median years coding: 6.0
- Top countries: Kenya (120)
- Top remote-work categories: NA (34), Hybrid (some remote, some in-person) (33), Remote (31)
- Top used languages: JavaScript (90), Python (73), SQL (73), HTML/CSS (72), TypeScript (52)
- Top wanted languages: JavaScript (59), Python (56), SQL (52), HTML/CSS (47), TypeScript (45)
- Job satisfaction categories (top): NA (68), 7 (12), 8 (9), 5 (7)

### What it likely means
The data may indicate pressure around growth clarity and workload while manager support signals remain relatively stronger.

### What to do next (prioritized actions)
1. HRBP + business leader: publish role progression criteria within 30 days.
2. Ops lead: rebalance workload and on-call distribution in next planning cycle.
3. Manager enablement lead: launch coaching refresh for quality + feedback within 45 days.

### What we should not conclude
- Do not infer causation between comments and business outcomes without additional data.
- Do not generalize subgroup findings where suppression thresholds may apply.

### Confidence & Data Limits
Findings are based only on provided metrics/comments and should be treated as directional.


## Skill 3: Messaging Pack

### Email draft
Audience: Exec leadership.
Team, survey results show solid strengths in manager support/inclusion and possible pressure in workload and career clarity. We are prioritizing actions on role clarity, capacity planning, and manager coaching, and we will report progress next cycle.

### Slide bullets
- Participation and favorability trends reviewed for this cycle
- Strength: manager support/inclusion signals
- Risk area: career growth clarity
- Risk area: workload and capacity
- Action 1: publish progression criteria (30 days)
- Action 2: workload rebalancing plan (next cycle)
- Action 3: manager coaching refresh (45 days)
- Confidence: directional, non-causal interpretation

### Talk track (30–60s)
This cycle shows encouraging strength in support and inclusion, with potential friction in career clarity and workload. Our response is a focused 30-45 day action plan led by HRBP, operations, and manager enablement. These insights are directional and should not be interpreted as causal claims.

### Confidence & Data Limits
No raw quotes, names, or identifiable subgroup references included.
